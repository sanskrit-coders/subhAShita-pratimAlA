# Current status 
* Disabled Instant run as of May 5 2017. 
* After including the jars in libs: Both in intellij and android studio, stuck with proguard problem:
  * `Error:Uncaught translation error: com.android.dx.cf.code.SimException: local variable type mismatch: attempt to set or access a value of type java.lang.Object using a local variable of type java.lang.Object[]. This is symptomatic of .class transformation tools that ignore local variable information.`

# Historical notes
* I started developing a java android app on android studio, but decided to try [switching to scala](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/subhAShita-pratimAlA-scala).
* For various reasons listed in the [scala project readme file](https://github.com/sanskrit-coders/subhAShita-pratimAlA-scala), I switched back here.
